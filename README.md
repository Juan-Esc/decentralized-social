This repository hosts the implementation for my Final Degree Project: _Design and Implementation of a Decentralized Social Network Using Blockchain._

This repository is divided into three projects and one shared library:

- [Backend](/backend): Server-side project, made with Node.js and Hono, running on Cloudflare Workers.

- [Frontend](/frontend): Client-side project with server-side rendering, made with Remix.

- [SContracts](/scontracts): Hardhat project containing smart contracts and demo/test scripts to interact with the blockchain.

- [Shared](/shared): Interfaces used in both projects.

Each project has its own README file with more information on how to run them and set up their development environment.
